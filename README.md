Produce Overdrive Analysis

This code analyzes the effectiveness of the Produce Overdrive program, designed to train agents in writing quality commercial insurance policies.

Metrics Analyzed:

Direct Written Premium (DWP) - total premium earned from new policies
Policies in Force (PIF) - number of active policies
Loss Ratio - portion of premium paid out in claims
Key Findings:

Produce Overdrive participants showed a significant increase in DWP and PIF compared to the control group.
Participants also appeared to write lower-risk policies as evidenced by a more stable loss ratio.
Program completion rates declined in the later sessions, possibly due to the pandemic.
Further Analysis:

The code can be used to explore reasons for declining completion rates.
More data might be needed to calculate the program's Return on Investment (ROI).
Tools Used:

Excel(data validation)
SAS/SQL (data cleaning and analysis)
Qlik (data visualization)
